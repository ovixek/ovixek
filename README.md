# 👋 Hi, I'm Abhishek Pujari  
### **Embedded Software Engineer | Firmware Developer | IoT | C/C++ | ARM Cortex-M | RTOS**

I’m an aspiring **Embedded Software/Firmware Engineer** passionate about building efficient, reliable, and real-time embedded systems.  
I love working close to the hardware — writing clean firmware, optimizing performance, and experimenting with microcontrollers, sensors, and IoT architectures.

Currently pursuing **PG-DESD** at **CDAC Sunbeam**, I’m strengthening my skills in C, Embedded C, ARM Cortex-M, RTOS concepts, Linux basics, and driver-level development.
